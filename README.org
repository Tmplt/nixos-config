* NixOS configuration

This repository constitutes the NixOS configurations for all my
systems - sans mobile phone, for now - managed via nixops(1) and Nix
flakes. This repository is published as a convenience for myself, but
also as a resource for people interested in Nix(OS).

Feel free to ping me if you have any questions at ~<v@tmplt.dev>~ or
~<~tmplt/public-inbox@lists.sr.ht>~.
